This project is the introduction to my curiousity of Android development with Kotlin.
I studied a 6 hour course on the language of Kotlin. After the course, I have 
decided to create a basic app that has two interactive buttons, after the 
user clicks the button it changes the color of the background depending
on which button was clicked, giving the user a interactive experience.
