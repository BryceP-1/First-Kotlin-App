fun sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int{
    return a + b
}
or
fun sum(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
instead of an if, if else, else do
when (number){
    0 -> print("0")
    1 -> print("1")
    else -> print("-1")
} when is the same as switch in java

Application Programming Interface(API)
Allows two programs to communicate on the web API.
Facilitates transfer of data.

How it works:
1. Request:
    API call is initiated by client via HTTP request
2. Receive:
    API goes to server, and gets the data
3. Response:
    API transfers the data back to requesting
    application in JSON format


In JSON arrays use []
Objects use {}
